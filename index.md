title: Libraries Hacked
---

Libraries Hacked is a project to promote open data, to help libraries publish their data, and to showcase projects using library data.

> &ldquo;Open data is data that anyone can access, use and share&rdquo;<br/> **Open Data Institute**: [What is open data and why should we care?](https://theodi.org/article/what-is-open-data-and-why-should-we-care/)

Publishing library data openly will ensure library services share data effectively, make better data-informed decisions, and enable innovation that can help the public and libraries.
