> &ldquo;Open data is data that anyone can access, use and share&rdquo;<br/>**Open Data Institute**<br/>[What is open data and why should we care?](https://theodi.org/article/what-is-open-data-and-why-should-we-care/)

Publishing library data openly will enable library services to share data practices, become more data-informed in decision making, and enable user-focussed applications to be built from that data.

Libraries Hacked is a project to promote open data, to help libraries to publish their data, and to showcase projects using open data.
