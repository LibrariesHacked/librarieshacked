Libraries Hacked is a project to promote open data, to help libraries to publish their data, and to showcase projects using library data.

> &ldquo;Open data is data that anyone can access, use and share&rdquo;

Publishing library data openly will enable library services to share data practices, become more data-informed in decision making, and enable innovative applications to be built from that data.
