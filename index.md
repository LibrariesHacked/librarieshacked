title: Libraries Hacked
---

Libraries Hacked is a project to promote open data, to help libraries publish their data, and to showcase projects using library data.

> &ldquo;Open data is data that anyone can access, use and share&rdquo;<br/> **Open Data Institute**: [What is open data and why should we care?](https://theodi.org/article/what-is-open-data-and-why-should-we-care/)

Publishing library data openly will ensure library services share data effectively, make better data-informed decisions, and enable innovation that can help the public and libraries.

Libraries Hacked was founded by Dave in 2014, and the projects have received generous contributions from many collaborators. All projects are open source and free to use and adapt. If you have any questions, [get in touch](/about).
