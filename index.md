Libraries hacked is a project, started in 2014, to promote the use of open data in libraries. That includes publishing data about libraries, as well as using other open datasets to enhance library data and create digital tools.

## Projects

### Library data schemas

A project in collaboration with the DCMS and others involved in open data in libraries. This sets out standard formats for publishing different public library datasets. See [Library data schemas](https://schema.librarydata.uk) for technical detail of the schemas. 

### Library lab

A project to bring together a community resource for prototyping library digital solutions. Available at [https://www.librarylab.uk](https://www.librarylab.uk).

## Prototypes

### Mobile libraries

A single online presence for mobile library stops, routes, vans and timetables. Providing the public with digital tools to track their mobile library. Available at [https://www.mobilelibraries.org](https://www.mobilelibraries.org).

## Small hacks

### Toon libraries dashboard

Exploring data from Newcastle City Libraries, which is published regularly as open data. The dashboard is available at [https://newcastle.librarydata.uk/](https://newcastle.librarydata.uk/).
