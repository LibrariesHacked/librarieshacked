Libraries Hacked was founded in response to the lack of open data about public libraries, in terms of their activity, catalogues, or even basic data such as locations. The goal has been to promote open data, including helping libraries publish their own data, and showing how library data can be used alongside with other open datasets.

Comprehensive public library data will enable the development of applications that are useful for the public and enhance library services.

The organisation is run by Dave Rowe, a technologist and software developer, library user, and ex-library staff member, in the South West of the UK. Many thanks to the contributors across all the projects.
