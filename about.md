title: About Libraries Hacked
---

Libraries hacked is a project started in 2014 to promote the use of open data in libraries. That includes aiding in publishing data about libraries, as well as using other library open data alongside other open datasets. The goal is to make interesting and useful software tools that can be used by library services and the public.

Please feel free to get in contact using by emailing [info@librarieshacked.org](mailto:info@librarieshacked.org) or get in touch with [@librarieshacked](https://twitter.com/librarieshacked) on twitter.

If you would like you can contribute to the running costs of this project.
