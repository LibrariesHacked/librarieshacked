Libraries hacked is a project started in 2014 to promote the use of open data in libraries. That includes publishing data about libraries, as well as using other open datasets to enhance library data. With that data the goal is then to make interesting and useful software tools that can be used by library services and the public.

Please feel free to get in contact using by emailing [info@librarieshacked.org](mailto:info@librarieshacked.org) or get in touch with [@librarieshacked](https://twitter.com/librarieshacked) on twitter.

## Funding

The project was initially self funded by myself, Dave Rowe. However, running costs for Libraries Hacked are approaching Â£1,000 per year, and I'd like to make these sustainable by requesting support. Anyone with an interest in the project, either personal or commercial can contribute to these costs which will cover:

* Domains names
* Database hosting
* Web servers

Any money received will go back into these costs.
