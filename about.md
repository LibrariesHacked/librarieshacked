Libraries Hacked was founded to promote open data in libraries. That includes helping libraries publish data about themselves, as well as showing how library data can be used alongside other open datasets. Comprehensive public library open data will enable the development of applications that are useful for the public and enhance library services.

The prototype tools and applications developed and maintained by Libraries Hacked are the Library Lab projects. See the [projects](/projects) page for a history.

The organisation is run by Dave Rowe, a software developer, library user, and ex-library staff member, based in the South West of the UK. Many thanks to the contributors across all the Library Lab projects.
